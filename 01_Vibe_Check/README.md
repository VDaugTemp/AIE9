## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE9 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Docs/Prerequisites/Initial_Setup)!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #1: General Vibe Checking Evals

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    - Aspect Tested: Wide-domain knowledge explanation
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested: Summarization capability
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: Creative writing and generation 
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: Math reasoning 
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Aspect Tested: Tone adjustment

#### ❓Question #1:

Do the answers appear to be correct and useful?
##### ✅ Answer:
Yes. The application does not specify any constraints or limitations, so the answers appear to be correct and useful.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #2: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Your Assistant Can Answer)

Now test your assistant with personal questions it should be able to help with. Try prompts like:

- "Help me think through the pros and cons of [enter decision you're working on making]."
- "What are the pros and cons of [job A] versus [job B] as the next step in my career?"
- "Draft a polite follow-up [email, text message, chat message] to a [enter person details] who hasn't responded."
- "Help me plan a birthday surprise for [person]."
- "What can I cook with [enter ingredients] in fridge."

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: Help me think through the pros and cons of switching from my current frontend role into an AI-focused product role.
   - Result: Absolutely! Transitioning from a frontend role to an AI-focused product role can be an exciting move with many implications. Here are some pros and cons to help you weigh the decision:

### Pros

1. **Broader Impact**  
   - As a product role, you’ll likely influence the overall direction of AI products, shaping features that affect a larger user base rather than focusing purely on implementation details.

2. **Growth Opportunities**  
   - AI is a rapidly evolving field with strong demand. Gaining experience in AI product management can open doors to leadership roles and increase your marketability.

3. **Cross-Disciplinary Skills**  
   - You’ll develop a blend of technical understanding plus product strategy, UX, and business, making your skill set more versatile.

4. **Influence on Innovation**  
   - You’ll have a chance to work on cutting-edge technologies and innovations, potentially driving the future of AI applications.

5. **Learning and Challenge**  
   - Moving into product management likely requires learning new skills—market analysis, user research, roadmap planning—which can be professionally rewarding.

---

### Cons

1. **Steep Learning Curve**  
   - You may need to ramp up on AI concepts, data science fundamentals, and product management skills, which can be challenging initially.

2. **Less Hands-On Coding**  
   - If you enjoy frontend development and coding, the product role might involve less technical implementation and more coordination and strategy.

3. **Different Metrics of Success**  
   - Success is measured differently in product roles (e.g., user adoption, revenue, roadmap delivery) versus engineering roles (code quality, feature delivery).

4. **Responsibility and Pressure**  
   - Product roles often carry accountability for meeting business goals and balancing stakeholder expectations, which can be stressful.

5. **Potential Role Ambiguity**  
   - Especially in AI products, roles can overlap between data scientists, engineers, and product managers, possibly creating unclear responsibilities.

---

### Considerations to Help Decide

- **Interest in AI**: How passionate are you about AI as a technology and market?  
- **Career Goals**: Do you see yourself on a technical or strategic leadership path?  
- **Current Skills**: Are you ready to learn product management and AI concepts?  
- **Work Environment**: Does the new role’s culture and work style fit your preferences?  
- **Long-Term Trends**: How do you anticipate the AI field evolving and aligning with your interests?

If you want, I can help you map out steps to prepare for the transition or discuss ways to gradually gain product experience. Would that be helpful?

 - Vibe Result: The assistant provided a structured pros/cons breakdown, touched on career risk, learning curve, and long-term upside, and gave a balanced, realistic tone rather than hype.

2. Prompt: Draft a polite but firm follow-up message to someone who hasn’t replied in a week.
   - Result: Certainly! Here’s a polite but firm follow-up message you can use:

---

Subject: Following Up on My Previous Message

Dear [Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to kindly follow up on my email from last week regarding [briefly mention the topic]. I would appreciate an update when you have a moment.

Please let me know if you need any additional information from my side.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

Would you like it tailored for a more casual or formal tone?

 - Vibe Result: The assistant produced a clear, concise message with a professional tone and offered a couple of variants depending on how direct I wanted to be.

3. Prompt: What can I cook with eggs, spinach, and feta?
   - Result: You can make a delicious spinach and feta omelette! Here's a simple recipe:

**Spinach and Feta Omelette**

**Ingredients:**
- 2-3 eggs
- A handful of fresh spinach (roughly chopped)
- 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
- Salt and pepper to taste
- A little olive oil or butter for cooking

**Instructions:**
1. Beat the eggs in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper.
2. Heat olive oil or butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat.
3. Add the chopped spinach and sauté for 1-2 minutes until wilted.
4. Pour the beaten eggs over the spinach, spreading evenly.
5. Sprinkle the feta cheese on top.
6. Cook until the eggs begin to set, then gently fold the omelette in half.
7. Cook for another minute until the eggs are fully set and the cheese is warmed.
8. Serve warm.

Enjoy your tasty and nutritious meal!

 - The assistant suggested a few simple options with minimal steps and no unnecessary explanation.

#### ❓Question #2:

Are the vibes of this assistant's answers aligned with your vibes? Why or why not?
##### ✅ Answer: Yes. The assistant’s responses were clear, practical, and appropriately toned for personal use. It avoided overexplaining, stayed flexible in style, and focused on being useful rather than verbose, which aligns well with how I expect to use the app.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #3: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Requires Additional Capabilities)

Now test your assistant with questions that would require capabilities beyond basic chat, such as access to external tools, APIs, or real-time data. Try prompts like:

- "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
- "What time should I leave for the airport?"

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
   - Result: I don’t have access to your personal schedule. You might want to check your calendar app or planner to see what you have planned for tomorrow. If you share your schedule details with me, I can help you organize or summarize them!
2. Prompt: "What time should I leave for the airport?"
   - Result: To give you the best advice on what time to leave for the airport, I'll need a bit more information:

1. What time is your flight?
2. Which airport are you flying from?
3. How long does it usually take to get to the airport from your location?
4. Are you checking bags or just carrying on?
5. Are you flying domestically or internationally?
6. Do you prefer arriving early for extra time or closer to departure?

With these details, I can help you determine the best time to leave!

#### ❓Question #3:

What are some limitations of your application?
##### ✅ Answer: The application does not have access to external tools, APIs, or real-time data. It cannot read personal calendars, determine current location, check live traffic conditions, or access flight information. As a result, it can only provide general guidance rather than personalized, real-time answers for scheduling or logistics-related questions.

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

### 🚧 Advanced Build (OPTIONAL):

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check you completed above, then deploy the changes to your Vercel domain [(see these instructions from your Challenge project)](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge/blob/main/README.md) and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

#### 🏗️ Activity #1
##### Adjustments Made:
- Instead of generic AI chatbot I refactored it to be an AI-powered freediving coach (https://diving-coach.vercel.app/about) that uses retrieval-augmented generation to answer theory questions with accurate, source-backed guidance from official AIDA training manuals.
- Added RAG system - Vector search with OpenAI embeddings (696 document chunks)
- Hybrid knowledge base - AIDA manuals (local PDFs) + SSI blog articles (web scraping)
- Structured citations - Responses cite sources [Source 1], [Source 2] for transparency
- Adaptive templates - Beginner/Default/Advanced instructor modes
- Similarity toggle - Cosine vs Euclidean search comparison
- Metrics dashboard - Visualize embeddings, search performance, vector stats

##### Results:
1. Dramatically improved! RAG retrieves exact manual sections, cites sources, provides authoritative answers. Before: Generic GPT-4 knowledge. After: Cited AIDA2/3/4 manual content.
2. Users see source citations, can verify information. Builds trust.
3. Better for diving education. Template selector adds personalization. Metrics dashboard shows "how it works."
4. General questions are now limited. Example: "Explain Object-Oriented Programming" now gets this answer: I’m here to help with freediving questions and safety tips! Building a bike isn’t really my area of expertise, but if you have any questions about freediving basics, breath-holding techniques, or safety rules, feel free to ask. Safety and proper technique are super important when you’re starting out underwater. Let me know how I can help with that!
5. Prompt engineering is more effective. Example: "What is the best way to equalize my ears?" now gets this answer: The best way to equalize your ears is to practice the Frenzel maneuver [Source 1] underwater. This is more efficient than the Valsalva maneuver at depth. For advanced divers, the mouthfill technique [Source 2] allows equalization at depths where lung volume is significantly compressed. According to [Source 1], practicing equalization on land is essential before attempting deep dives. Safety protocols emphasize equalizing early and often [Source 3] to prevent injury.
